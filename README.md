# Build Sprint Standup Guide

The goal of Build Sprint Standup is to make constant progress every day and to remove obstacles that are easy to solve.

* Duration: 10-15 minutes
* Every student answers the three Standup Questions
* If any blocking issues are brought up, they are discussed after the meeting finishes
* The goal is to quickly find out what everyone has done, what they plan to do, and if they need help
* Schedule 1:1's to solve blocking issues after the meetings if more help is required

## Standup Questions

In the first several standups, you'll want to ask these questions before each person talks.

The TL or instructor should guide the stand-up meeting so it moves along quickly and doesn't become a long discussion.

1. **What did you do yesterday?**
2. **What are you doing today?**
3. **Are you blocked on anything?**

## Ideas

Take notes for each student if you guide the standup

**Example notes in Markdown**
